# SUPER HERO PUG 
As a Pug lover I decided make this game. My main goal is spread my love for Pugs with everyone and maybe make some of the players have the same love as I do. 

## Getting Started

To win this game you have to achieve **1000** points, each food will get you 10 points. Challenging, rigth?
